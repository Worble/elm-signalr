Just like last time! But now WITH A WHOLE NEW WORLD OF TYPE SAFETY IN OUR 5 LINE INDEX.

NEVER USE TYPE UNSAFE CODE AGAIN

# Project Structure

All the source files can be found under `/src`

All tests can be found under `/tests`

All custom webpack loaders can be found under `/loaders`

All distribution files can be found under `/dist`

# Building from Source

- Run `npm i` or `yarn` in the root folder

- Run any of the following in the root folder (feel free to substitute `yarn` for `npm run`)

      	* Running `yarn dev` will compile a new unoptimized app.js in dist with elm set to debug mode

      	* Running `yarn serve` will start a devserver that watches for changes on localhost:8080 (if available) running an unoptimized debug build

      	* Running `yarn prod` will create an optimized production build in dist

# Running Tests

- Run `npm i` or `yarn` in the root folder if you have not already done so

- Run `npx elm-test` or `yarn elm-test` in the root folder
